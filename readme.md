# Fish (Literature) Card Game
## Version 2

#### ‚ù§ Thank you to the 41th New Jersey Governor's School in the Sciences!

## Website link: https://fish-vnm9.onrender.com/
#### The website may take a moment to load because that's what you get for free
#### The rules of the game are on the website if you are unfamiliar

## Using the site
#### Either select a room and hit enter room, or create a new room.
If creating a new room, you will then be prompted to enter a name for the room
#### Then you will be asked to enter a name which cannot be the same as anyone else in the same room
#### You will then enter a waiting area. If you are the room creator, you can start the game when you have 6 people.
#### Everyone will automatically be moved to the game screen once it starts.
#### Once on the game screen, it is the turn of the player with the green bubble.
#### Ask an opponent for a card by clicking on their name, choosing a half_suit, and choosing a card.
#### When declaring, choose a half suit, then choose which teammate has the shown card.
#### If someone is declaring, they are highlighted in yellow and nobody should be able to do anything else.

## Later developments
#### If you feel that there is a problem you want fixed, open an issue on GitHub and I will try to take a look when I have time.
